# 🔍 Repository Component Assessment Tool

You are tasked with conducting a comprehensive assessment of the attached repository folder(s) against our established guidelines and standards. This assessment should be thorough, actionable, and consistent with our quality benchmarks.

### Phase 1: Comprehensive Validation
Conduct detailed validation across these dimensions:

#### ✅ **Compliance Areas**
- **Structure & Organization**: File/folder organization, naming conventions
- **Code Quality**: Implementation patterns, best practices adherence
- **Documentation**: Completeness, accuracy, format compliance
- **Security**: Authentication patterns, secret handling, permissions
- **Error Handling**: Resilience patterns, failure scenarios, recovery procedures
- **Performance**: Efficiency patterns, optimization opportunities
- **Maintainability**: Modularity, reusability, consistency

#### ⚠️ **Areas for Improvement**
- **Missing Requirements**: Identify gaps against standards
- **Inconsistencies**: Highlight deviations from established patterns
- **Technical Debt**: Note areas requiring refactoring or updates
- **Security Concerns**: Flag potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations

### Phase 2: Scoring and Prioritization

#### 📊 **Compliance Score Calculation**
Provide a numerical score (0-100) with breakdown:
- **Structure & Organization**: __/100
- **Implementation Quality**: __/100  
- **Documentation Standards**: __/100
- **Security & Best Practices**: __/100
- **Error Handling & Reliability**: __/100
- **Overall Compliance**: __/100

#### 🎯 **Priority Classification**
Categorize findings by urgency:
- **🚨 Critical (High Priority)**: Security issues, compliance blockers, breaking changes
- **⚠️ Important (Medium Priority)**: Best practice violations, maintainability concerns
- **💡 Enhancement (Low Priority)**: Optimization opportunities, documentation improvements

## 📝 Assessment Report Structure

## 🔄 Assessment Guidelines

### **Thoroughness Requirements**
- **Read ALL files** in the attached component completely
- **Consider context** from related repository components when relevant
- **Provide specific examples** with file names and line numbers where applicable

### **Quality Standards**
- **Be constructive**: Focus on improvement, not just criticism
- **Be specific**: Provide actionable, concrete recommendations
- **Be consistent**: Apply standards uniformly across similar components
- **Be contextual**: Consider the component's purpose and constraints

### **Evidence-Based Assessment**
- **Quote specific code/text** that demonstrates compliance or violations
- **Reference line numbers** and file paths for precision
- **Compare against** established patterns from instruction files
- **Validate claims** with concrete examples

## 🎯 Special Considerations

### **Known Exceptions**
- **Power Platform Provider**: May require exceptions to AVM compliance (see power-platform-provider-exception.md)
- **Demo Repository**: Some best practices may be intentionally simplified for demonstration
- **Legacy Components**: May follow different patterns if documented

### **Context Awareness**
- **Project Purpose**: This is demonstration material for PPCC25 session
- **Audience**: Technical professionals learning Infrastructure as Code
- **Quality Bar**: Should reflect professional, production-ready standards

## ✅ Assessment Execution
