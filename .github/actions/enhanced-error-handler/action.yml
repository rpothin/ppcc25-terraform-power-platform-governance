# Enhanced Error Handler Composite Action
# Provides standardized error handling and troubleshooting guidance for workflow failures
# This action creates contextual error messages with operation-specific guidance and systematic
# troubleshooting steps to improve user experience and reduce support overhead.
# Part of the GitHub Workflows improvement initiative following AVM patterns.

description: 'Provides standardized error handling and troubleshooting guidance'

# Input parameters that define the error context and control error reporting behavior
inputs:
  error-context:
    description: 'Context where the error occurred (e.g., "Terraform initialization in 02-dlp-policy")'
    required: true
    # Provides specific context about where the failure occurred within the workflow
    # Used to create meaningful error messages that help users understand the failure point
    # Should include both the operation and the target (configuration, module, etc.)
  operation:
    description: 'Operation that failed (terraform-init, terraform-plan, terraform-apply, etc.)'
    required: true
    # Defines the specific Terraform or workflow operation that failed
    # Used to provide operation-specific troubleshooting guidance and common solutions
    # Must match predefined operation types for optimal guidance generation
  exit-code:
    description: 'Exit code of failed operation for detailed analysis'
    required: false
    # Optional exit code from the failed process for enhanced error analysis
    # When provided, helps users understand the severity and type of failure
    # Standard exit codes: 0=success, 1=general error, 2=syntax error, etc.
  include-troubleshooting:
    description: 'Include troubleshooting guide link in output'
    required: false
    default: 'true'
    # Controls whether to include link to comprehensive troubleshooting documentation
    # Set to 'false' for internal errors where external docs aren't relevant
    # Default 'true' ensures users always have access to detailed guidance

# Output values that provide standardized error information and guidance
# No direct outputs are returned as this action focuses on error reporting and user guidance
# The action generates GitHub Actions annotations (error, notice, warning) that appear
# in the workflow run summary and provide immediate feedback to users
outputs: {}
  # This action operates through GitHub Actions logging and annotation system
  # Error information is communicated via ::error, ::notice, and ::warning annotations
  # These annotations appear in the Actions UI and provide structured troubleshooting guidance

# Define this as a composite action that runs shell-based error processing
