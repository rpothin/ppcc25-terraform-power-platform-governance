# TERRAFORM VALIDATION DETECT-AND-DISPATCH WORKFLOW FOR POWER PLATFORM GOVERNANCE
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# Detects changed Terraform configurations/modules and dispatches per-path validation workflows in parallel.
#
# 🎯 WHY THIS EXISTS:
# - Decouples change detection from validation for robust, parallel, and isolated quality checks
# - Automates validation only for changed configurations/modules, reducing CI/CD runtime and resource use
# - Aggregates and summarizes results for governance and auditability
#
# 🔒 SECURITY DECISIONS:
# - OIDC authentication for all cloud and Power Platform connections
# - All jobs requiring secrets run in the 'production' environment for protection
# - Principle of least privilege applied to all permissions
#
# ⚙️ OPERATIONAL CONTEXT:
# - Concurrency group ensures only one detect-and-dispatch run per ref at a time
# - Timeout values sized for comprehensive validation without resource waste
# - Supports both PR and manual dispatch triggers
#
# 📋 INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS:
# - Uses composite action for change detection
# - Dispatches single-path validation workflow for each changed path
# - Aggregates results and calls execution summary workflow
