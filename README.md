## 🎯 Purpose

This repository contains the demonstration elements from the **"Enhancing Power Platform Governance Through Terraform: Embracing Infrastructure as Code"** session at the Power Platform Community Conference 2025. It serves as a **quickstart guide** for exploring how Terraform can be used to implement Power Platform governance and replace the traditional "ClickOps" approach.

The repository provides practical examples and reusable patterns to help organizations transition from manual Power Platform administration to automated, code-driven governance using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles.

## 🚀 What's Included

- **Terraform modules** for Power Platform governance components
- **Configuration examples** demonstrated in the PPCC25 session
- **Migration patterns** from ClickOps to Infrastructure as Code
- **Best practices** for enterprise Power Platform governance
- **Integration scenarios** with Azure
