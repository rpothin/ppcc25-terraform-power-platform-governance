# Power Platform Environment Configuration

This configuration creates and manages Power Platform environments following Azure Verified Module (AVM) best practices with Power Platform provider adaptations.

## Use Cases

This configuration is designed for organizations that need to:

1. **Environment Standardization**: Deploy consistent Power Platform environments with standardized naming, regions, and security settings across development, staging, and production
2. **Lifecycle Management**: Onboard existing environments to Infrastructure as Code management while preventing accidental deletion through lifecycle protection
3. **Governance Compliance**: Ensure environments meet organizational standards with validated configuration parameters and security-first defaults
4. **Multi-Environment Deployment**: Support scalable environment provisioning across multiple tenants and regions with environment-specific configurations

## Usage with Resource Deployment Workflows

```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow input
inputs:
  configuration: 'res-environment'
  tfvars-file: 'production'  # Uses tfvars/production.tfvars
```
