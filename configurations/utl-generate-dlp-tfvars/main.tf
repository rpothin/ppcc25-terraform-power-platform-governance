# Smart DLP tfvars Generator Configuration
#
# This configuration automates the generation of tfvars files for DLP policy management by processing exported policy and connector data, supporting both new policy creation and onboarding of existing policies to IaC.
#
# Key Features:
# - AVM-Inspired Structure: Follows Azure Verified Module (AVM) best practices with Power Platform provider adaptations
# - Anti-Corruption Layer: Outputs only discrete computed attributes, never full resource objects
# - Security-First: OIDC authentication, no hardcoded secrets
# - Utility-Specific: No resource deployment, only data processing and export
# - Strong Typing: All variables use explicit types and validation (no `any`)
# - Provider Version: Centralized `~> 3.8` for `microsoft/power-platform`
#
# Architecture Decisions:
# - Provider Choice: Using microsoft/power-platform for native Power Platform integration
# - Backend Strategy: Azure Storage with OIDC for secure, keyless state management
# - Resource Organization: Utility module for data transformation and export

# Data processing logic will be implemented here to:
# - Parse exported DLP policy and connector data (from JSON files generated by export utilities)
# - Map policy structure to tfvars format (business, non-business, blocked connectors, etc.)
# - Handle both new policy creation (from template) and onboarding (from export)
# - Validate generated tfvars for correctness and completeness

# Placeholder for future implementation
