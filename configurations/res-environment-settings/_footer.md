## Authentication

This configuration requires authentication to Microsoft Power Platform:

- **OIDC Authentication**: Uses GitHub Actions OIDC with Azure/Entra ID
- **Required Permissions**: Power Platform Service Admin role
- **State Backend**: Azure Storage with OIDC authentication

## Data Collection

This configuration does not collect telemetry data. All data queried remains within your Power Platform tenant and is only accessible through your authenticated Terraform execution environment.

## ⚠️ AVM Compliance

### Provider Exception

This configuration uses the `microsoft/power-platform` provider, which creates an exception to AVM TFFR3 requirements since Power Platform resources are not available through approved Azure providers (`azurerm`/`azapi`). 

**Exception Documentation**: [Power Platform Provider Exception](../../docs/explanations/power-platform-provider-exception.md)

### Complementary Details

- **Anti-Corruption Layer**: Implements TFFR2 compliance by outputting environment settings IDs and computed attributes as discrete outputs
- **Security-First**: Sensitive data properly marked and segregated in outputs 
- **AVM-Inspired**: Follows AVM patterns and standards where technically feasible
- **Resource Deployment**: Deploys primary Power Platform resources following WAF best practices

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Failures**
- Verify service principal has Power Platform Service Admin role
- Confirm OIDC configuration in GitHub repository secrets
- Check tenant ID and client ID configuration

**Permission Errors** 
- Ensure service principal is not blocked by conditional access policies
- Verify admin permissions for Requires System Administrator or Environment Admin permissions in the target Power Platform environment. Service principal must have appropriate permissions assigned via res-environment-application-admin configuration or manual assignment. management
- Check for tenant-level restrictions on automation

Common issues include insufficient permissions for environment settings modification, configuration drift from manual admin center changes, and settings conflicts with existing environment policies. Verify service principal permissions and environment admin access before applying configuration.
